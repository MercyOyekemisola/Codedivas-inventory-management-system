# Inventory Management System – Codedivas

This is a **group project** by Team **Codedivas**.
The system helps manage products in a small shop or warehouse. It allows adding, removing, updating, and reporting on products using **basic JavaScript concepts** (objects, arrays, functions, loops, if/else).

## Features

* **Add Product** → Add a new product with ID, name, price, and quantity.
* **Remove Product** → Remove an existing product from inventory.
* **Update Stock** → Increase or decrease stock of a product.
* **Generate Report** → View summary of all products, total value, and low-stock alerts.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MercyOyekemisola/Codedivas-inventory-management-system.git
cd Codedivas-inventory-management-system
```

### 2. Open the Project in a Browser

1. Open the folder.
2. Double-click **index.html**.
3. Right-click → **Inspect → Console** to see the outputs.

## How It Works

* Products are stored as **objects** inside an **array (`inventory`)**.
* Core functions include:

  * `addProduct(product)`
  * `removeProduct(productId)`
  * `updateStock(productId, newQuantity)`
  * `generateReport()`
* Test cases are included at the bottom of `index.js`.

When you open the console, you will see:

* New product being added.
* A product removed.
* Stock updated.
* A final inventory report with totals and low-stock items.
